\usage{
map_dist(
  dist,
  wastd_url = wastdr::get_wastd_url(),
  fmt = "\%d/\%m/\%Y \%H:\%M",
  cluster = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{Turtle nest and general disturbance and predation, e.g.
\code{\link{wastd_data}$nest_dist}. This data contains both dist/pred
recorded against nests and general signs of disturbance or predation.}

\item{wastd_url}{The base URL for WAStD, default: \code{get_wastd_url()}}

\item{fmt}{The desired date format, default: "d/m/Y H:M"}

\item{cluster}{If TRUE, cluster map markers. Default: FALSE.
Note: In some places, the aerial background layer does not provide imagery
at sufficient zoom levels, and therefore restricts the map zoom at levels
where the cluster markers don't expand. Switch to "Place names" to let
cluster markers expand.}
}
\value{
A leaflet map
}
\description{

}
\details{
Creates a Leaflet map with an interactive legend offering to toggle
each disturbance class separately.
The maps auto-zooms to the extent of data given.
