#' @param cluster If TRUE, cluster map markers. Default: FALSE.
#'   Note: In some places, the aerial background layer does not provide imagery
#'   at sufficient zoom levels, and therefore restricts the map zoom at levels
#'   where the cluster markers don't expand. Switch to "Place names" to let
#'   cluster markers expand.
